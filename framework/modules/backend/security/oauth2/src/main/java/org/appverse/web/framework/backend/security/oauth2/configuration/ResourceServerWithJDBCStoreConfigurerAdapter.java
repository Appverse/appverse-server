 * Convenient setup for an OAuth2 Resource Server that uses a

 * configure method if you want to change default HttpSecurity (by default requiring 
 * authentication for any request)

 * JDBCTokenStore requires a particular database model provided by Spring as an SQL script
 * that you need to create in your database schema.
